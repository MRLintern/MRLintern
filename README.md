### Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthew Lintern-Monro, but I go by Matt

I'm a Technologist with experience of working in Scientific Computing and Data Science.
My past experience includes working in the Oil & Gas Industry and Retail Sector (BI & HR Analytics), utilising a wide range of technologies,
allowing Stakeholders to make informed business decisions. My experience in these industries has seen me work on a wide range of projects. For example, from
developing shell scripts to load, process and unload large Seismic data sets, to using Machine Learning to try and understand employee absence
rates for Tesco and reduce the Â£2million financial loss. 

If you're interested in any of the work you find in my profile, I'd love to hear from you, especially in areas such as Numerical/Scientific Computing.
It would be great to hear about suggestive improvements to my code or possible collaboration on open-source projects.
