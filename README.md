## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthew Lintern-Monro, but I go by Matt

### Who am I?

I consider myself to be a polyglot programmer with various interests. If I'm unfamiliar with a language and its technlogies (frameworks, libraries etc), I will teach myself these to get a project done.
Most of the projects I have on GitHub started their life written in Python, and I have then used this as a proof-of-concept for further development into
a different language. With this in mind, I'm always intrigued by using a different language to develop a project I've already completed.
For example, the project [Systems Monitor similar to htop](https://github.com/MRLintern/System-Monitor) was developed in __Modern C++__. Could there be
an advantage in writing this application in __Rust__ or __Golang__, given these are both System Level languages? Anyway, what do I usually do in the workplace? 
Find out below...
</br>
<br>
My past experience includes working in the Oil & Gas Industry and Retail Sector (BI & HR Analytics), utilising a wide range of technologies,
allowing Stakeholders to make informed business decisions. My experience in these industries has seen me work on a wide range of projects. For example, from
developing shell scripts to load, process and unload large Seismic data sets, to using Machine Learning to try and understand employee absence
rates for Tesco and reduce the Â£2million pa financial loss.

### What I'm up to?

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on:
  
  - ___Bash-Hacks___. A folder of mini `Bash scripts` which perform all manner of automation tasks. Working on this now and then so I'll always be adding to it when I'm not doing something more substantial.
  - Now in the process of creating a __Multithreaded Linux Kernel__. This will be a fun, long and hard project.
### Ideas for Possible Projects

- Developing a __Multithreaded 2D Chanel Flow Solver__ for the __Navier-Stokes Equations__, using the __Finite Difference Method__ and the __Successive Over-Relaxation Method__, in a variety of languages: e.g. __C__, __C++__, & __Fortran__.
- Developing a __Linear & Non-Linear Covective Heat Flow Solver__, in __C++__, using the __Finite Element Method__ and solved via the __Successive Over-Relaxation Method__ 
- Employing __Fortran__ and the __GPU__ to build a __Linear/Non-Linear Shallow Water Equation Solver__.
- __Physics-Informed Machine Learning__. Applying this to __Inverse Problems__ in __Geophysics__. E.g. __Seismic tomography__ and __Geomagnetism__.
- Developing a __Compiler__ using the __LLVM Project__.
- Developing a __Compiler__ in __C/C++__.
- Developing a __Multithreaded Linux Kernel__.
- Developing an __Interpreter__ &/or __Compiler__ in __Go__.
- Learning the __SYCL Programming Model__ and creating some basic applications with it.
- Creating a simple __Crypto Trading Platform__ in __C++__.
- Creating a __Cryptocurrency Trading Bot__ with a __User Interface__ in __Python__.
- Creating a simple __Trading Bot__ in __Java__. I've never worked with __Java__ and I've always been put off by it; Might be a good time to see why!
- Creating a basic __Online Oil & Gas Data Management System__ called ___GeoDataManager___, developed in __Golang__.  
- Could a __Physics Game Engine__ be used for __Scientific Simulation/Modelling__?
- Writing a solver for the __(Discrete) Fast Fourier Transform__ using __OpenCL__. I studied __Geophyics__ so I'm naturally interested in applications of __Signal Processing__.
- __GPU Programming__ and __Fluid Dynamics__: Taking a look at the __SYCL Framework__ and using it to develop a solver.
    
     


### What do I love?
       
- __C__.
- __Modern C++__.

- __Computational Science__. Like my repo's show, I love developing __Numerical Algorithms__ to solve Scientific and Engineering Problems.
- __Systems Programming__: I love knowing how things work under the hood. E.g. __Compilers__ and __Operating Systems (Linux)__.
- __Data Science__.
- __Data Engineering__.
- __Scientific Programming__: Modelling and Simulation of problems in __Fluid Dynamics__ & the __Physical Sciences__.
- __Applied Mathematics__: E.g. __Numerical Analysis__, __Linear Algebra__, __Ordinary/Partial Differential Equations__ and __(Computational) Fluid Dyanamics__.
