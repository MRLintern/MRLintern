## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthew Lintern-Monro, but I go by Matt

### Contact Me:

* <lintern121184@gmail.com>
 

### Interests
- Languages I prefer developing with: __C, Modern C++ and Fortran__. However, I've got a decent amount of experience using __MATLAB__ & __Python__ from my time working in the __Oil & Gas__ and __HR/Retail Analytics__ industries.
  

- __Machine Learning (Fluid Dynamics)__. E.g. Application of __Deep Learning Algorithms/Methods__ for replacing or augmenting __Conventional Numerical Solvers__ in __Fluid Dynamics__.
- __Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing)__. I've used this in a couple of jobs and it proved to be very informative. E.g. I used __Sentiment Analysis__ while working at Tesco to understand customer opinions of Tesco products.
- __Computational Science__. 
- __Scientific Programming__: E.g. __Modelling and Simulation__ of problems in __Fluid Dynamics__ & the __Physical Sciences__.


### What I'm up to?
* ___PoissonDensity___: a `2D C++17` Solver for solving __Poissons Equation__ in order to find the __Mass-Density Distribution__ within __Earth's Mantle__. The __Finite Element Method__ is used to discretise Poisson's Equation and __Eigen__ is used for managing the __System of Algebraic Equations__. The __Problem Domain__ consists of an __Annulus__, which is divided into __Finite Element Triangles__. The __Mesh__ is uploaded via a file, created using ___Gmsh___, a __Finite-Element Mesh Generator__.


* ___Conjugate_Gradient_Method___: a `C++ Solver` which implements the __Conjugate Gradient Method__ for solving __Algebraic Systems__ of the form __Ax = b__. This solver will be used in the [PoissonDensity](https://github.com/MRLintern/PoissonDensity) project.

### Sample Projects
Some projects I'm quite chuffed of.

#### Scientific Computing

- [Application of the Shallow Water Equations to Problems in Oceanography & Planetary Atmospheres](https://github.com/MRLintern/Shallow_Water_Equations). This software has been used by a chap in China for his Ph.D in Hydrogeology. Please ask for information on the details of his Ph.D and its use.
- [Navier-Stokes Equation Solver for 2D Open Channel Flow](https://github.com/MRLintern/NavierStokes-2D-ChannelFlow).
- [Application of the U-Net Convolutional Neural Network to Classify Salt and Sediment Structures in Oil & Gas Reservoirs](https://github.com/MRLintern/Salt_and_Sediment_Classification).
- [StokesianFlow; A Modern C++ Solver which uses the Finite Element Method and the Eigen Template Library to Model a Viscous Liquid Flowing through an Open Channel/River](https://github.com/MRLintern/StokesianFlow).
