# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthew Lintern-Monro, but I go by Matt

## Contact Me:

* <lintern121184@gmail.com>
 

## Interests
- Languages I love working with:
   * __C__,
   * __Modern C++__,
   * __Fortran__,
   * __Python__ &
   * __MATLAB__.
  

- __Machine Learning (Fluid Dynamics)__. E.g. Application of __Deep Learning Algorithms/Methods__ for replacing or augmenting __Conventional Numerical Solvers__ in __Fluid Dynamics__.
- __Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing)__. I've used this in a couple of jobs and it proved to be very informative. E.g. I used __Sentiment Analysis__ while working at Tesco to understand customer opinions of Tesco products.
- __Computational Science__. 
- __Scientific Programming__: E.g. __Modelling and Simulation__ of problems in __Fluid Dynamics__ & the __Physical Sciences__.
- __Systems-Level Programming__.


## What I'm Up To

### Currently Working on:

* Developing a __Modern (Pure) Modular Fortran__ version of [NavierStokes-2D-Open-Channel-Flow](https://github.com/MRLintern/NavierStokes-2D-Open-Channel-Flow) using __OOD__. Unlike the original solver, this one uses ___Coarrays___ and ___Domain Decomposition___ for `Parallelism`.


### Future Projects:
* The following projects are ___ideas___; I might not do them.




* ___Ocean-Kit___: A `C++17` __Library__ which helps users solve __Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)__ that model different __2D Ocean Models__.

* ___Tsunami-Solver___: A `C++17` Non-Linear Solver which models __Tsunamis__ by solving the __2D Shallow Water Equations__.

* ___Barotropic-Circulation___: A `C++17` solver which models __Large-Scale Ocean Gyres__ and __Wind-Driven Circulation__ by solving the __Linearized Shallow Water Equations__ on a __Beta Plane__ using __FEM__.
  
* ___GeoCoreFlow___: This project looks at producing __Core-Surface Flow Maps/Models__ at the __Earths Core Mantle Boundary (CMB)__. These maps are created by solving an __Ill-Posed Inverse Problem__. The ___Magnetic Induction Equation___ is inverted to find the __Flow Velocity__ of the __Earth's Liquid Outer Core__ at the top of the __CMB__. ___Magentic Field Data___ from, e.g. __CHAMP__ will be used to for modelling the __Geomagnetic Field__ near Earth's surface. I.e. mapping the __Geomagnetic Field__ onto a __Spherical Shell__, and __Secular Variation Data__ from, e.g., __CHAOS__ or __IGRF__ will be used to invert the __Magnetic Induction Equation__ with __Physical Constraints/Assumptions__. Key __Technologies/Techniques/Theory__ to be used: `C++17`, `Eigen Template Library`, `Python`, __Inverse Theory__, __Fluid Dynamics__, __Spectral Methods__ and other __Numerical Methods__ for the solver.
