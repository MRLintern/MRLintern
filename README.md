## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthew Lintern-Monro, but I go by Matt

### Contact Me:

* <lintern121184@gmail.com>
 

### Interests
- Languages I prefer developing with: __C, Modern C++ and Fortran__. However, I've got a decent amount of experience using __MATLAB__ & __Python__ from my time working in the __Oil & Gas__ and __HR/Retail Analytics__ industries.
  

- __Machine Learning (Fluid Dynamics)__. E.g. Application of __Deep Learning Algorithms/Methods__ for replacing or augmenting __Conventional Numerical Solvers__ in __Fluid Dynamics__.
- __Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing)__. I've used this in a couple of jobs and it proved to be very informative. E.g. I used __Sentiment Analysis__ while working at Tesco to understand customer opinions of Tesco products.
- __Computational Science__. 
- __Scientific Programming__: E.g. __Modelling and Simulation__ of problems in __Fluid Dynamics__ & the __Physical Sciences__.


### What I'm Up To
* ___Possible Project___: ___GeoCoreFlow___: This project looks at producing __Core-Surface Flow Maps/Models__ at the __Earths Core Mantle Boundary (CMB)__. These maps are created by solving an __Ill-Posed Inverse Problem__. The ___Magnetic Induction Equation___ is inverted to find the __Flow Velocity__ of the __Earth's Liquid Outer Core__ at the top of the __CMB__. ___Magentic Field Data___ from, e.g. __CHAMP__ will be used to for modelling the __Geomagnetic Field__ near Earth's surface. I.e. mapping the __Geomagnetic Field__ onto a __Spherical Shell__, and ___Secular Variation Data__ from, e.g., __CHAOS__ or __IGRF__ will be used to invert the __Magnetic Induction Equation__ with __Physical Constraints/Assumptions__. Key __Technologies/Techniques/Theory__ to be used: `C++17`, `Eigen Template Library`, `Python`, __Inverse Theory__, __Fluid Dynamics__, __Spectral Methods__ and other __Numerical Methods__.

### Sample Projects
Some projects I'm quite chuffed of.

#### Scientific Computing

- [Application of the Shallow Water Equations to Problems in Oceanography & Planetary Atmospheres](https://github.com/MRLintern/Shallow_Water_Equations). This software has been used by a chap in China for his Ph.D in Hydrogeology. Please ask for information on the details of his Ph.D and its use.
- [Navier-Stokes Equation Solver for 2D Open Channel Flow](https://github.com/MRLintern/NavierStokes-2D-ChannelFlow).
- [Application of the U-Net Convolutional Neural Network to Classify Salt and Sediment Structures in Oil & Gas Reservoirs](https://github.com/MRLintern/Salt_and_Sediment_Classification).
- [StokesianFlow; A Modern C++ Solver which uses the Finite Element Method and the Eigen Template Library to Model a Viscous Liquid Flowing through an Open Channel/River](https://github.com/MRLintern/StokesianFlow).

#### High Performance Computing Applications for Physical Simulation
- [2D Poisson Equation Solver with OpenMP](https://github.com/MRLintern/2D_Poisson_Equation_OpenMP).
- [2D Heat Equation Solver using OpenMP](https://github.com/MRLintern/2D-Heat-Equation_OpenMP).
- [2D Heat Equation Solver using MPI](https://github.com/MRLintern/2D_Heat_Equation-MPI).
- [1D Wave Equation Solver using MPI](https://github.com/MRLintern/1D_Wave-Equation-MPI).
