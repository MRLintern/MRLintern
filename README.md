## About Me
---
* __Geophysicist__ by trade who fell into __Data Science, Machine Learning__ and __Data Engineering__.
* My real passion is __Software Engineering__ using __Modern C++__, and using it to solve problems in __Applied Mathematics__, the __Physical Sciences__ and aspects of __Engineering__.
* I'm keen to start learning more about __Systems Programming and Engineering__, so I'll be looking at some systems-level projects, such as developing a __Compiler__ and __Operating System__, for example.
* I'm also interested in __Computational Science__; it takes the best parts of __Computer Science__ and combines them with __Science__ and __Engineering__.

- __Machine Learning (Fluid Dynamics)__. E.g. Application of __Deep Learning Algorithms/Methods__ for replacing or augmenting __Conventional Numerical Solvers__ in __Fluid Dynamics__.
- __Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing)__. I've used this in a couple of jobs and it proved to be very informative. E.g. I used __Sentiment Analysis__ while working at Tesco to understand customer opinions of Tesco products.
- __Computational Science__. 
- __Scientific Programming__: E.g. __Modelling and Simulation__ of problems in __Fluid Dynamics__ & the __Physical Sciences__.
- __Systems-Level Programming__.

## What I'm Up To
---
### Currently Working on:

* Updating skill-set; currently looking at `C++23`. It still feals very much like `C++` but with hints of `Rust` and `Python`; really cool and very nice!

* ___BVPLib___: A `C++20` __Library__ for solving __Boundary Value Problems__, using modern features, such as `modules`.

* ___SigProLib___: A `C++17` __Cross-Platform__ __Shared Library__ which can be used to perform basic signal processing operations. E.g., __Signal Processing Statistics__, __Convolution__ of two signals and __Time__ to __Frequency__ __Domain__ conversion via the __Fourier Transform__. 


### Projects on Hold:

*  ___2DWavePINN___: A `C++17` program which solves the __2D Wave Equation__ via a ___Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)___. A lot of issues with this at present and I'm currently focusing more of my time on ___SigProLib___.

### Future Projects:
* The following projects are ___ideas___; I might not do them.

* Refactoring [1D_Wave_Equation-MPI](https://github.com/MRLintern/1D_Wave-Equation-MPI) into a more __modular__ form. Additions to be added: `Unit Testing` and `Plotting`.

* ___TsunamiSolver___: A `C++17` Non-Linear Solver which models __Tsunamis__ by solving the __2D Shallow Water Equations__.


* ___OceanLib___: A `C++17` __Library__ which helps users solve __Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)__ that model different __2D Ocean Models__.

* Developing a __Modern (Pure) Modular Fortran__ version of [NavierStokes-2D-Open-Channel-Flow](https://github.com/MRLintern/NavierStokes-2D-Open-Channel-Flow) using __OOD__. Unlike the original solver, this one uses ___Coarrays___ and ___Domain Decomposition___ for `Parallelism`.


* ___BarotropicCirculation___: A `C++17` solver which models __Large-Scale Ocean Gyres__ and __Wind-Driven Circulation__ by solving the __Linearized Shallow Water Equations__ on a __Beta Plane__ using __FEM__.

* ___basix___: a small __Linux Kernal__ written in __C__.

* ___ros___: a basic __Operating System__ written in __Rust__.

#### C++14
- [StokesianFlow; A Modern C++ Solver which uses the Finite Element Method and the Eigen Template Library to Model a Liquid Flowing through an Open Channel/River](https://github.com/MRLintern/StokesianFlow).

#### C++20
- [Parallel_Linear_Solver: C++20 Software which uses OpenMP to Parallelise the 3 Classic Algebraic Iterative Methods: Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and Successive Over Relaxation](https://github.com/MRLintern/Parallel_Linear_Solver). 

### High Performance Computing: Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing
#### C
- [2D Poisson Equation Solver with OpenMP](https://github.com/MRLintern/2D_Poisson_Equation_OpenMP).
