- __Machine Learning (Fluid Dynamics)__. E.g. Application of ___Deep Learning Algorithms/Methods___ for replacing or augmenting __Conventional Numerical Solvers__ in __Fluid Dynamics__.
- __Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing)__. I've used this in a couple of jobs and it proved to be very informative. E.g. I used __Sentiment Analysis__ while working at Tesco to understand customer opinions of Tesco products.
- __Computational Science__. 
- __Scientific Programming__: E.g. __Modelling and Simulation__ of problems in ___Fluid Dynamics___ & the ___Physical Sciences___.
- __Systems-Level Programming__.

## What I'm Up To
---
### Currently Working on:

* ___Deep-Earth_HeatFlow___: A Modern __Fortran (2008+)__ solver, __Parallelising__ the __Jacobi Method__ with __OpenMP__ to model __Heat-Diffusion__ across the __Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB)__ of the __Earth__. Go [Here](https://github.com/MRLintern/CMB_HeatFlow) to see it.

* ___LowLatencyNet___: A `C++20` experimental __Framework__ exploring __Low-Latency Network I/O__ on __Linux__. Go [here](https://github.com/MRLintern/LowLatencyNet) to keep updated.

### Projects on Hold:

*  ___SigProLib___: A `C++17` __Cross-Platform__ ___Shared Library___ which can be used to perform basic signal processing operations. Go [here](https://github.com/MRLintern/SigProLib) to see it. All of the signal processing techniques have now been developed. Its now a case of constructing the library itself.

* ___BVPLib___: A `C++20` __Library__ for solving ___Boundary Value Problems___, using modern features, such as `modules`, rather than using traditional methods, such as `header files`. This project follows the worked example in the book:
  ___Guide to Scientific Computing in C++___, by __Joe Pitt-Francis__ and __Jonathan Whiteley__. **Note 1**: I don't feel they create a ___library___; they create more of a "header file" for __BVPs__. **Note 2**: They don't provide certain
  source files, such as `vector.cpp` and `matrix.cpp`. These are exercises for the reader and I will be creating these too. All source code for their/that project is pure `C++11` with no use of useful APIs. I might use `Eigen` to tackle the
  ___linear algebra___. 
  
### Future Projects:
* The following projects are ___ideas___; I might not do them.

* __Parallelise__ aspects/regions of the __StokesianFlow__ solver via the __OpenMP__ API.

*  ___2DWavePINN___: A `C++17` program which solves the __2D Wave Equation__ via a ___Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)___.

* Refactoring [1D_Wave_Equation-MPI](https://github.com/MRLintern/1D_Wave-Equation-MPI) into a more __modular__ form. Additions to be added: `Unit Testing` and `Plotting`.

* ___TsunamiSolver___: A `C++17` Non-Linear Solver which models __Tsunamis__ by solving the __2D Shallow Water Equations__.


* ___OceanLib___: A `C++17` __Library__ (`.so` file) which helps users solve __Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)__ that model different __2D Ocean Models__.

* Developing a __Modern (Pure) Modular Fortran__ version of [NavierStokes-2D-Open-Channel-Flow](https://github.com/MRLintern/NavierStokes-2D-Open-Channel-Flow) using __OOD__. Unlike the original solver, this one uses ___Coarrays___ and ___Domain Decomposition___ for `Parallelism`.


* ___BarotropicCirculation___: A `C++17` solver which models __Large-Scale Ocean Gyres__ and __Wind-Driven Circulation__ by solving the __Linearized Shallow Water Equations__ on a __Beta Plane__ using __FEM__.

* ___basix___: a small __Linux Kernal__ written in __C__.

* ___ros___: a basic __Operating System__ written in __Rust__.
