## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthew Lintern-Monro, but I go by Matt

### Interests
- Languages I prefer developing with: __C, Modern C++ and Fortran__. However, I've got a decent amount of experience using __MATLAB__ & __Python__ from my time working in the __Oil & Gas__ and __HR/Retail Analytics__ industries.
  

- __Machine Learning (Fluid Dynamics)__. E.g. Application of __Deep Learning Algorithms/Methods__ for replacing or augmenting __Conventional Numerical Solvers__ in __Fluid Dynamics__.
- __Machine Learning (Natural Language Processing)__. I've used this in a couple of jobs and it proved to be very informative. E.g. I used __Sentiment Analysis__ while working at Tesco to understand customer opinions of Tesco products.
- __Computational Science__. 
- __Scientific Programming__: E.g. __Modelling and Simulation__ of problems in __Fluid Dynamics__ & the __Physical Sciences__.


### What I'm up to?
- ___viscousRiver___: a __Modern C++__ solver for modelling a ___Viscous Fluid flowing through a Channel___. Makes use of the __Finite Element Method (FEM)__ and the __Eigen Template Library (Eigen)__ for the __Algebra__. Currently refactoring the software to make it more modular; its all in 1 `main.cpp` source file.

- ___2D-NavierStokes_Flow___: a __C++__ solver for solving the __2D Navier-Stokes Equations__ for a fluid in a River/Open Channel. Makes use of the __Eigen Template Library (Eigen)__ to implement the __Successive Over Relaxation (SOR) Algorithm__. This project is essentially a __C++__ version of the ___NavierStokes-2D-ChannelFlow___ __Fortran__ solver. However, instead of using __Finite Differences__ it will use the __Finite Element Method (FEM)__. The __Mesh Points__ will be loaded into the application. The `meshPoints.dat` file from [viscousRiver](https://github.com/MRLintern/viscousRiver) will be used. Note: ___viscousRiver___ has to be run to use the resulting `meshPoints.dat` file.
 

- ___Parallel_Linear-Solvers___: __C++20__ __OOD__ software which utilises __OpenMP__ and the __Red-Black Ordering Scheme__ to parallelise the __Jacobi__, __Gauss-Seidel__ and __Successive Over Relaxation (SOR)__ iterative methods. __Bench-Marking__, __Performance__ and __Convergence Rates__ are considered, and __matplotlib-cpp__ will be used to __Visualise Convergence__ using a __Python Script__.

### Sample Projects
Some projects I'm quite chuffed of.

#### Scientific Computing

- [Application of the Shallow Water Equations to Problems in Oceanography & Planetary Atmospheres](https://github.com/MRLintern/Shallow_Water_Equations). This software has been used by a chap in China for his Ph.D in Hydrogeology. Please ask for information on the details of his Ph.D and its use.
- [Navier-Stokes Equation Solver for 2D Open Channel Flow](https://github.com/MRLintern/NavierStokes-2D-ChannelFlow).
- [Application of the U-Net Convolutional Neural Network to Classify Salt and Sediment Structures in Oil & Gas Reservoirs](https://github.com/MRLintern/Salt_and_Sediment_Classification).
- [viscousRiver; A Modern C++ Solver which uses the Finite Element Method and the Eigen Template Library to Model a Viscous Liquid Flowing through an Open Channel/River](https://github.com/MRLintern/viscousRiver).

#### High Performance Computing Applications for Physical Simulation
- [2D Poisson Equation Solver with OpenMP](https://github.com/MRLintern/2D_Poisson_Equation_OpenMP).
- [2D Heat Equation Solver using OpenMP](https://github.com/MRLintern/2D-Heat-Equation_OpenMP).
- [2D Heat Equation Solver using MPI](https://github.com/MRLintern/2D_Heat_Equation-MPI).
