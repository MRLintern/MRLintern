## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthew Lintern-Monro, but I go by Matt

### Who am I?

I consider myself to be a polyglot with various interests. If I'm unfamiliar with a language and its technlogies (frameworks, libraries etc), I will teach myself these to get a project done, something I've had to do in and outside of industry.
These various interests are:

- __Systems Programming__. I love understanding how things work at their most basic level. Essentially creating software for software.
- __Scientific Computing__. My interest in Programming and Computer Science started from my time at University, using Fortran to model the Earths Geomagnetic Field and the Fluid Dynamics of Earths Core.
- __Blockchain Development__. I'm new to this but will be doing something project wise soon.
- __Quant Development__. I love C++ and the idea of attempting to develop a basic Low Latency Trading System sounds amazing. It would be great to try this using Rust too.

However, I'm also looking at developing software thats a bit more "general purpose", such as the project I'm currently working on.

### What I'm up to?

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on:
  
 
 
### What do I love?
- __Rust__. 
- __Golang__.       
- __C__.
- __Modern C++__.
- __Fortran__.
- __MATLAB__.
- __Data Structures & Algorithms__.
- __Bash Scripting__.
- __High Performance Computing__: I love seeing how __HPC__ can help with Scientific/Simulation problems. I'm keen to start learning about the __SYCL__ framework too.
- __Computational Science__. Like my repo's show, I love developing __Numerical Algorithms__ to solve Scientific and Engineering Problems.
- __Systems Programming__: I love knowing how things work under the hood. E.g. __Compilers__ and __Operating Systems (Linux)__.
- __Data Science__.
- __Data Engineering__.
- __Scientific Programming__: Modelling and Simulation of problems in __Fluid Dynamics__ & the __Physical Sciences__.
- __Applied Mathematics__: E.g. __Numerical Analysis__, __Linear Algebra__, __Ordinary/Partial Differential Equations__ and __(Computational) Fluid Dyanamics__.


### What are you interested in?
Take a look at these repositories; some of my applications might interest you and might help you out in some way. Or you might look at them and think "___Why on Earth has he done it that way, when he could have done it this way!___". If thats the case, please let me know as I'm always looking to better myself and my applications.
